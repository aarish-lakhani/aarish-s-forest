Fruits are gifts from the plant. Cherish them, and as a thank you, make sure to spread some of the seeds in a suitable environment. 

Mushrooms can be treated like fruit, except since they don't have seeds, be sure to spread their spores around by either carrying them in a mesh bag or a wooden basket.

Leaves are important for plants to product their energy, but often they don't need all of their leaves to survive. Try not to remove more than 1/4 of the leaves. 

Roots and stems are the hardest to forage sustainably. Requires killing the plant. Don't take more than you think the remaining population can replace over the next growing season.
## Exception to all of the rules above:
Invasive, non-native species. Harvest to your heart's content!
