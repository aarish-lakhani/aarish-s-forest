For large quantities of foraged goods, bring a wooden basket or a water bottle
For mushrooms, use a wooden basket or a mesh bag to spread the spores (See [[Sustainable Foraging]])
For greens and roots, a plastic bag works best to keep the material fresher for longer
For berries or soft fruits, use a molded fiber container (like the ones they have at the farmers markets), a basket (but it will get stained), or a glass or plastic container that is rigid

Multi-tool with a folding knife for mushrooms or other things you need to cut off of a plant
Foraging knife to dig roots from hard, dense soils
Pruners or snips for woodier plants

In the kitchen, there's still more work to be done. Use a dehydrator for [[Preserving Your Harvest]] and a nutcracker to access what can be consumed from the nuts you have harvested.
