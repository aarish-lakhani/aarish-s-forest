All of the plants and fungi listed here are not easily confused for harmful look-alikes. This is meant to be an easy and accessible introduction to foraging.

However, some [[Common Highly Toxic Plants, Nuts, and Mushrooms]] are also mentioned.

Be cautious of where you collect foraged food in urban areas. There are many heavy metals common in urban soils, which are concentrated in the roots and low lying leaves of plants. Nuts and fruits are safe to forage from urban areas, as trees do a terrific job of filtering out heavy metals. However, the soil in this area can generate dust with heavy metals, so be sure to wash any foraged food thoroughly. 

Some communities will use herbicides to control weeds in urban areas. Be cautious when foraging dandelion and knotweed, which are commonly perceived to be "weeds". If the weed looks like it is dead or beginning to curl and brown, skip it.

TLDR:

In urban areas:
- Do not forage root vegetables or low lying leaves
- Forage nuts and fruits
- Wash all foraged food
- Be cautious when foraging weeds due to herbicides
