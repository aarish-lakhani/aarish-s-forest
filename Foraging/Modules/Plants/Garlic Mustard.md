## Invasive, harvest as much as you'd like (and more to promote native species, please!)
## All parts edible

Similar flavor to broccoli rabe and spicy mustard green

IDENTIFICATION: [[Biennial Plant]], starts as a low lying leafy plant (see image 1) then flowers (see image 2, where it is about to flower). [[Scalloped Leaves]], heart shaped, 1-3 inches wide. Emerges as a [[Rosette]] when it is first growing. Second year is sends up flower stalks with white flowers. Flower clusters before opening resemble tiny broccoli florets. Flowers, once open, have 4 petals. When leaves or stalk is crushed, it'll smell like garlic / mustard! 
Found in [[Deciduous Forest]]. Found in early spring.
Harvest by pulling up with root (so it doesn't grow back!)

Seeds can be used to make a homemade mustard (don't let the seeds fall, it is invasive), leafy greens sauteed in oil
