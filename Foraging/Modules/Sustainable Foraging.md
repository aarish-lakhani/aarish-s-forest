Fruits are gifts from the plant. Cherish them, and as a thank you, make sure to spread some of the seeds in a suitable environment. 

Mushrooms can be treated like fruit, except since they don't have seeds, be sure to spread their spores around by either carrying them in a mesh bag or a wooden basket.

Leaves are important for plants to product their energy, but often they don't need all of their leaves to survive. Try not to remove more than 1/4 of the leaves. 

Roots and stems are the hardest to forage sustainably. Requires killing the plant. Don't take more than you think the remaining population can replace over the next growing season.
## Exception to all of the rules above:
Invasive, non-native species. Harvest to your heart's content!

# Honorable Harvest

When foraging, it's important to be ethical in your harvest and respect it and the environment around you. 

**Some key rules:**
- Familiarize yourself with the plants and animals around you
- Reciprocate what you take from the plants by protecting and propagating their populations
- Using all that you harvest
- Sharing your harvest with others
- Never taking the first plant of a species you see, so you can be sure you aren't taking the last in that area
