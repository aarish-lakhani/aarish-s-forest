Hello, and welcome!

If you have encountered this Obsidian Vault, congratulations! You're a stinky, mud-covered, environmental geek who loves being outside in their natural environment. I'm just like you. I love you.

I purchased a course from Home Grown and Hand Gathered, who provided me with all of the content and material outlined within this vault. Screenshots from their course are provided, along with internet images. Check out their Instagram, they try to do a challenge every year to see how long they can live off of their land. Here is their website, containing flavorful recipes with these foraged goods:Â [https://homegrownhandgathered.com/](https://homegrownhandgathered.com/)

To start, I recommend going through these modules:

- [[Where to Forage]]
- [[Safe Foraging]]
- [[Common Highly Toxic Plants, Nuts, and Mushrooms]]
- [[Sustainable Foraging]]
- [[Foraging Tools]]
- [[Preserving Your Harvest]]
- [[Spring]]
- [[Summer]]
- [[Winter]]

And lastly, don't forget that this is information to be shared. Although we are taking from the ecosystem around us, it is more sustainable than purchasing sustenance from a grocery store. Please share this with anyone who might find it interesting. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or concerns; since I have access to the course, they also let me ask them questions! I would be happy to be a medium to have any of your foraging questions answered.
